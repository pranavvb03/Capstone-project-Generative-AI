# Capstone-project-Generative-AI

Introduction
Generative AI has immense potential to disrupt ECommerce image management strategies.Having high-quality product imagery is crucial for attracting and engaging customers.Generative Adversarial Networks or GAN can produce high-resolution images, customize outfits, and poses depending on a fashion model.They can create models that fit into the brand’s image in a variety of body types and outfits.

Problem statement
E-commerce platforms often lack diverse and high-quality images for their product listings, impacting sales and customer trust.
Create a generative AI model that produces high-quality product images for e-commerce platforms by utilizing a generative adversarial network (GAN) to augment existing product images, generating multiple high-resolution images from different angles and in various settings to enhance product listings.
